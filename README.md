# Java-Airline-Reservation-System
The Airline Reservation System is a Java-based application designed to automate and simplify the process of booking airline tickets. This system provides users with a convenient interface to search flights, book tickets, cancel reservations, and check flight schedules, reducing the reliance on manual processes at airline counters.

The application is built using Java with object-oriented programming principles for modularity and scalability. It employs file handling or databases (like MySQL) to store information such as passenger details, flight schedules, and bookings. The system ensures data security, prevents double bookings, and allows easy retrieval of booking information.
